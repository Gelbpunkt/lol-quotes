      "Danger is as fun as you let it be.",
      "I am definitely more confident in dangerous situations.",

      "If it don't get out of control, it ain't a party.",

      "I'm gonna' burn this place down, then help them build it back up - so I can burn it again!",
      "I dance so fine I kill.",
      "Xayah? Hey! Damn, where is she? I hate it when she leaves.",
      "Without wild magic, we have no children, we have no future.",
      "When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.",
      "I do not wish to kill the mortals. I want them to hear the music.",
      "The humans will never understand our kind until they hear the song.",
      "I will make them dance. I will make them hear.",
      " Hey, Xayah.",
      "Yeah?",

      "You remember the Aphae waterfall?",
      "Yeah.",
      "I'd like to go there again.",

      "Darling?",
      "Yes?",
      "Pay attention to me.",
      "What the hell were you thinking?",
      "Back there?",
      "Yes.",
      "I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking.",
      "How can humans not hear the magic?",
      "They're too busy building things.",
      "Why?",
      "Because... they're afraid.",
      "Thanks.",
      "For what?",
      "Not saying 'I told you so.'",
      "Okay, last time, it was totally my fault.",
      "What was?",
      "Good answer.",
      "You going to marry me today?",
      "Ask me again tomorrow.",
      "I always do.",
      "Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?",
      "Not now!",
      "Love is so cruel!",
      "What's after this?",
      "Another road, another horizon.",
      "Hm. Good.",
      "It's gonna' be okay.",
      "We can do this.",
      "Hey, I know that.",
      "You know I love you.",
      "What we have is greater than some human word.",
      "Did you notice the sky?",
      "It's lovely.",
      "Not as beautiful as you.",
      "I am R-r-r-akan!",
      "Ugh, what's with the accent?",
      "I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?",
      "No. No, I do not.",
      "If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?",
      "Hubba hubba.",
      "No, that's not whistling.",
      "If you don't want to do this... ",
      "No! I want to!",
      "You're only here because of me.",
      "... nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me.",
      "What are those things humans wear on their feet?",
      "Shoes.",
      "I need shoes. Red ones. I need them **so** bad.",
      "Did I tell you I love you?",
      "Yes... but say it anyway.",
      "I love you.",
      "Why do you never say yes?",
      "'cause then... I wouldn't get to hear you ask.",
      "Can we just stay here?",
      "We must keep moving.",
      "Aw... ",
      "Xayah? I think we got a problem... ",
      "Think, or know?",
      "I... **know** we got a problem?",
      "I'm so tired... ",
      "You gotta rest, honey.",
      "Everyone is depending on me.",
      "Everyone can wait.",
      "What would you do if I died?",
      "I would... burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever.",
      "Aw... that's sweet.",
      "I think scars are sexy.",
      "Okay. I'll get more.",
      "Where do we go?",
      "Wherever our hearts desire.",
      "How do you like me today?",
      "More than yesterday, less than tomorrow.",
      "Do I make you happy, Rakan?",
      "Every day of my life.",
      "I'm lucky to have you.",
      "No. I'm the lucky one.",
      "I swear, you will be the death of me.",
      "I'm fine with that.",
      "Me too.",
      "If we get separated, I'll find you.",
      "We won't get separated.",
      "You're already wandering off.",
      "No, I'm not! ... only a little.",
      "You are stunning and beautiful... ",
      "Why, thank you, darling.",
      "Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey.",
      "I need you to be more careful.",
      "If anybody's gonna' die first, it's gonna' be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a **terrible** color on me.",
      "Play it safe!",
      "Baby, I don't do safe!",
      "You okay?",
      "Oh, this is all so intense!",
      "You can't tell me you weren't impressed!",
      "With what?",
      "Just generally! I'm amazing!",
      "Honey, what are you doing?",
      "I can't die looking this good!",
      "After this, how about we get some human food?",
      "A nice dinner?",
      "Chocolate!",
      "That's not what---",
      "We're eating chocolate!",
      "Do you remember the plan?",
      "Nope, but let's do it!",
      "I have a cunning plan.",
      "Really? What is it?",
      "I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!",
      "I think you intimidate human females.",
      "Yeah, so?",
      "It's kinda hot!",
      "Should I show them the dance?",
      "Show them the dance.",
      "You thinking about me?",
      "I'm a little busy!",
      "That's very upsetting!",
      "Baby, what did I tell you?",
      "Try not to die?",
      "Close enough.",
      "Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?",
      "Yeah, gross.",
      "Rakan has arrived!",
      "I saw you. Everyone can see you.",
      "Yeah! That's what I like!",
      "Can I start off?",
      "You want to start it off?",
      "Let's start it off!",
      "I'm a humble entertainer!",
      "Really, darling?",
      "Yeah, I'm the best.",
      "Who is that gorgeous thing over there?",
      "Now's not the time, darling.",
      "It's always the time!",
      "Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey.",
      "Hi.",
      "I'm handling it, dear.",
      "Are you?",
      "I was, I--- I will.",
      "How long do we fight?",
      "Until we are free. Until magic is free.",
      "Is that after lunch?",
      "Do you remember our escape route?",
      "Uh... yes?",
      "I'll take that as a no.",
      "How will we know if the plan works?",
      "We'll still be alive!",
      "Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!",
      "I am not a piece of meat.",
      "Caw caw, caw caw!",
      "You used the secret call! Is everything alright?",
      "We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!",
      "Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just... go that way!",
      "No-one can control me!",
      "That's right, babe.",
      "Look sharp, baby.",
      "Ha! When don't I?",
      "If I vanished, what would you do?",
      "I would never be whole again.",
      "Am I good to you?",
      "The best.",
      "I'm going rogue!",
      "There's a surprise.",
      "Be right back!",
      "Will you?",
      "Who can know these things?",
      "You! You can know these things!",
      "I love you!",
      "I know.",
      "Oh, here we go again. Mhm. Mister Scatman, uh huh. ... oh, he's got me going now... ",
      "Sing it with me, baby.",
      "I don't know the words.",
      "You know, I ain't really about making fun of people, but you... make that difficult.",
      "I got three rules. You're breaking two of them with that outfit.",
      "Can we just get started already?",
      "Why are you so boring?",
      "Man, are you digging this air?",
      "Oh, you're bumming me out.",
      "Is... 'totally bogus' your thing?",
      "So, when you got dressed this morning, was this the look you were going for?",
      "There's this thing called grooming. You should try it.",
      "Hey, I'm right here. So, can you be less uptight and lame now?",
      "I ain't gonna' kill you. She is!",
      "Nice to unmeet you.",
      "Kiss me, honey.",
      "Why now?",
      "Give them a pretty last image.",
      "So, just tiger stuff? Buddy, you've got to mix it up.",
      "I know you're Vastaya, but your tribe... lacks style!",
      "So, you just... run around in the jungle, huh? I mean, I'm not judging, if that's what you're into. Nerd.",
      "I think we're supposed to laugh, now?",
      "At what?",
      "Smile and nod, honey.",
      "Can we leave now?",
      "Do you want to smell it? **Not for you!**",
      "You want to smell it? **No flower for you!**",
      "Let's get it!",
      "I got some moves for you!",
      "This is you getting slapped!",
      "I'm here to party!",
      "Here's what's happening!",
      "Damn, this is exciting!",
      "I'm gonna' slap all of you!",
      "It ain't a party without a fight!",
      "What you looking at?",
      "Am I not magnificent?",
      "Let's dance!",
      "Where you going? Where you going?",
      "I got one more thing for you!",
      "You gonna' feel this one!",
      "Be silent and live.",
      "We will not fade away.",
      "Time to go to work!",
      "Ain't gonna slow me down!",
      "Dance or die!",
      "Let's get interesting.",
      "This is the message!",
      "You will see my dance!",
      "You will see the dance of death.",
      "This is all so intense!",
      "I don't do safe!",
      "Woo! You animals are dumb!",
      "Yep! I'm amazing!",
      "I can't die looking this good!",
      "Let's get it started!",
      "I got some moves for ya!",
      "I need to get in it!",
      "Hey! I got a joke for you!",
      "I'm right here!",
      "Am I not magnificent?",
      "I'm gonna' tear this place **up!**",
      "Oh! I need to get in there!",
      "Hey, what did the five fingers say to the face?",
      "I feel alright!",
      "I'm gonna' hit 'em!",
      "I'm incorrigible!",
      "You got something to say?",
      "They gonna' love this!",
      "Hello? You ready for me?",
      "Hey, the party's over here!",
      "You're gonna' get hurt!",
      "Who... wants... to dance?",
      "Nothing's fun without risk!",
      "You're gonna' love this!",
      "What you looking at?",
      "Look at me now!",
      "I'm gonna' slap all of you!",
      "Pay attention! Woo!",
      "I like parties with a little violence!",
      "They ain't ready! They ain't ready!",
      "Challenge accepted!",
      "I have killed for her! I will kill for her again.",
      "Time to get started!",
      "Hell, let's do it!",
      "Want to see some sweet moves?",
      "Look! I'm a distraction!",
      "Hey! What you doing?",
      "Count it down! One, two, they dead!",
      "I'm here! We can get it started!",
      "I can be very distracting!",
      "Try and hit me, fool!",
      "Slap!",
      "You like that?",
      "My palm sends its regards!",
      "How's that face?",
      "Get some!",
      "Insulted yet?",
      "Man, that's insulting!",
      "You going to take that from me?",
      "Can't stop me!",
      "You're welcome!",
      "Learn to dance!",
      "Yeah!",
      "Say yeah!",
      "Oh yeah!",
      "Watch me!",
      "Are you having fun over there?\"",
      "I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!",
      "The fight's here!, by me!",
      "It's the same fight!",
      "You're doing this!",
      "Doing it!",
      "I hate everyone today!",
      "Even me?",
      "Not you, baby.",
      "Should we give them a fighting chance?",
      "Only if we want to have fun.",
      "Who do I hit?",
      "One of them!",
      "Ah.",
      "This reminds me of our first dates!",
      "Good times!",
      "Mind if I cut in, Rakan?",
      " Be my guest, miella!",
      "That was beautiful, baby!",
      "You see that?",
      "I couldn't miss it!",
      "Make them remember!",

      "But... but... food!",
      "You're cute today!",
      "Eyes on the prize, baby.",
      "Let me at 'em!",
      "Rakan is very enthusiastic.",

      "Not a single one.",
      "Use your words!",
      "Can't! Punching!",

      "Riku, how can you be tired already? We just got here!",
      "What was the plan again? Oh yeah! Destroy hope, bring the second coming of darkness, and get some new hair gel. I'm almost out.",
      "Good guys? Ha! How quaint! I just learned that word. I like it.",
      "Yeah. The Star Guardians looked a whole lot better when I was on the team.",
      "Get ready to shine, Riku. We're gonna knock out some starlights.",
      "Woo! Being bad just feels so good!",
      "Perfection doesn't exist. Except for my hair. Ooh, and Xayah.",

      "Living the dream... The dream of darkness.",
      "I only believe in myself. Ooh, and Xayah.",
      "Dancing between the rules!",
      "Safe is for nerds. I do danger.",

      "Life is way more fun when you give up the rules.",
      "Used to be a square. Then, I embraced the darkness. Woohoo!",
      "I do what I want. No Star Guardian can say the same.",
      "Life sucks without Xayah. But it is less complicated.",
      "The universe tends towards chaos. I'm just helping it along.",

      "Hoohoo! I feel a fight comin'.",
      "Safety is boring, Riku. Let's start a fight!",
      "Riku! I did not rescue you from a cold dead planet so that you could laugh at me! I rescued you so you could hold my mirror and tell me I look good!",
      "Stars are just sad, lonely lightbulbs floating in space revolving endlessly in a cycle they can't control... Anyone have chocolate? I'm craving chocolate.",
      "Woo! Danger brings out my bad side. Just kidding. All my sides are equally breathtaking.",
      "How do the Star Guardians see anything? Their sparkles are so darn... Sparkly!",
      "This place'll look different when we're in charge, Riku. More dark matteR? Dark matter everywhere! As far as the eye can see!",
      "Ooh, Riku! Let's destroy everything they hold dear and then laugh in their faces!",
      "It's not that I completely lost my sense of hope. It's that the light inside my died a long time ago leaving a dark, very good-looking soul.",
      "My cloak is woven from the whispers of starfields, the secrets of galaxies, the wind of the seventh moon. Ooh, and it swishes. Swish, swish!",
      "When Xayah and I were abandoned on a desolate planet I realised something. I don't like being alone. Oh, and spiky space-squids are the worst.",
      "Woo! I am so far past redemption, I'm in the fun zone! Population: Rakan.",
      "You'd look better just a little bit dead.",
      "Yeah, gonna be an easy fight.",
      "There's a word you remind me of. Oh yeah: Basic.",
      "Wow! That hair... Really doesn't do you any favours.",
      "Ah, yes. The spirit of wisdom and harmony. Or was it lies and stupidity?",
      "So, you think you're rebellious, Jinx?",
      "It's tiny nerd and her pet Pix? How quaint.'Quaint'. What a great word.",
      "Star Guardians? More like Star Losers... Star Losers.",
      "With two guns, you're twice as bland, Sarah.",
      "Neeko! If you distract me with myself one more time...",
      "Oh no! A Star Hammer! Ooooooo!",
      "What are you gonna do, heal me to death?",
      "Control is an illusion, Syndra.",
      "Xayah, uh, is there a secret plan I'm not aware of? Are you a double agent?",
      "Bet you wish you hadn't taught me how to play with dark matter, huh, Zoe?",
      "Are we gonna fight, or are you just gonna braid each other's hair now?",
      "Ugh. So every day is leg day, huh?",
      "Yeah, show 'em, Riku! Riku? Agh, Riku!",
      "Riku's gonna mess you up bad! No, Riku! I said attack them! Them!!!",
      "Insults? Haha! Boring. Lemme show you a real slap in the face.",
      "C'mon, Riku. Truce? *Riku chittering* Ugh, never mind!",
      "Riku. I got your favourite star-shaped treats. *Riku chittering* Ahh, not the hair! Not the hair!",
      "Hahahaha! Oh, I was just laughing at how bad your joke was.",
      "I look good. Cosmically good!",
      "You ain't ready for this darkness!",

      "Do I make you happy, Rakan?",
      "Every day of my life.",
      "I'm lucky to have you.",
      "No. I'm the lucky one.",
      "I swear, you will be the death of me.",
      "I'm fine with that.",
      "Me too.",
      "If we get separated, I'll find you.",
      "We won't get separated.",
      "You're already wandering off.",
      "No, I'm not! ... only a little.",
      "You are stunning and beautiful... ",
      "Why, thank you, darling.",
      "Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey.",
      "I need you to be more careful.",
      "If anybody's gonna' die first, it's gonna' be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a **terrible** color on me.",
      "Play it safe!",
      "Baby, I don't do safe!",
      "You okay?",
      "Oh, this is all so intense!",
      "You can't tell me you weren't impressed!",
      "With what?",
      "Just generally! I'm amazing!",
      "Honey, what are you doing?",
      "I can't die looking this good!",
      "After this, how about we get some human food?",
      "A nice dinner?",
      "Chocolate!",
      "That's not what---",
      "We're eating chocolate!",
      "Do you remember the plan?",
      "Nope, but let's do it!",
      "I have a cunning plan.",
      "Really? What is it?",
      "I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!",
      "I think you intimidate human females.",
      "Yeah, so?",
      "It's kinda hot!",
      "Should I show them the dance?",
      "Show them the dance.",
      "You thinking about me?",
      "I'm a little busy!",
      "That's very upsetting!",
      "Baby, what did I tell you?",
      "Try not to die?",
      "Close enough.",
      "Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?",
      "Yeah, gross.",
      "Rakan has arrived!",
      "I saw you. Everyone can see you.",
      "Yeah! That's what I like!",
      "Can I start off?",
      "You want to start it off?",
      "Let's start it off!",
      "I'm a humble entertainer!",
      "Really, darling?",
      "Yeah, I'm the best.",
      "Who is that gorgeous thing over there?",
      "Now's not the time, darling.",
      "It's always the time!",
      "Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey.",
      "Hi.",
      "I'm handling it, dear.",
      "Are you?",
      "I was, I--- I will.",
      "How long do we fight?",
      "Until we are free. Until magic is free.",
      "Is that after lunch?",
      "Do you remember our escape route?",
      "Uh... yes?",
      "I'll take that as a no.",
      "How will we know if the plan works?",
      "We'll still be alive!",
      "Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!",
      "I am not a piece of meat.",
      "Caw caw, caw caw!",
      "You used the secret call! Is everything alright?",
      "We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!",
      "Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just... go that way!",
      "No-one can control me!",
      "That's right, babe.",
      "Look sharp, baby.",
      "Ha! When don't I?",
      "If I vanish, what would you do?",
      "I would never be whole again.",
      "Am I good to you?",
      "The best.",
      "I'm going rogue!",
      "There's a surprise.",
      "Be right back!",
      "Will you?",
      "Who can know these things?",
      "You! You can know these things!",
      "I love you!",
      "I know.",
      "Oh, here we go again. Mhm. Mister Scatman, uh huh. ... oh, he's got me going now... ",
      "Sing it with me, baby.",
      "I don't know the words.",
      "I'm about to ruin your day.",
      "Please, for the sake of us both, go far away.",
      "I'm going to murder you a thousand times.",
      "Am I supposed to be intimidated right now? I'm not sure what's going on.",
      "Please, don't make me tryhard. I'm not in the mood.",
      "Can I just hate you to death?",
      "I can't even--- I don't know where to begin.",
      "The next one to call me 'edgy' is getting choked to death.",
      "I will punch your soul in the face.",
      "I ain't gonna' kill you. She is!",
      "Nice to unmeet you.",
      "Kiss me, honey.",
      "Why now?",
      "Give them a pretty last image.",
      "Get out there and take a bullet for me - like a gentleman.",
      "You're not bad for someone who isn't Rakan.",
      "If we do this right, only one of us get shot.",
      "Block the hits for me - please?",
      "Make me look good, and I'll make you look good, got it?",
      "How am I supposed to work with - whatever this is?",
      "Don't embarrass me.",
      "Mages. Too insufferable to live.",
      "Mages are lucky if they can cast a minor hex.",
      "Yordles. Why did it have to be Yordles?",
      "Yordles are the reason no-one takes us Vastaya seriously.",
      "Okay. Who invited the Yordle?",
      "You want to be mortal? You are mu'takl.",
      "You betray your heritage, Ahri.",
      "I don't want to spill Vastayan blood, Rengar.",
      "We were not made to fight each other.",
      "Aw, poor sad little mummy! I just want to take you home.",
      "I don't want to hurt you, space dragon. We could be such good friends.",
      "I can't wait to burst your bubble.",
      "Who does your wardrobe? Fire them. Immediately.",
      "Wait, magic powered sword legs? Is this a joke?",
      "Is this another timeline where I beat you up again?",
      "When I'm done with Ionia, I'll come for Demacia.",
      "Where can I get one of those delightful chthonic god-clutch purses? Does it come in purple? The god, not the bag.",
      "I want your happiness to evaporate.",
      "I want to travel the world with you.",
      "But is it really okay?",
      "Your talking is not improving this wonderful silence.",
      "You're gross. Never change.",
      "You call that a rebellious nature?",
      "You call that being a vampire?",
      "I'm insulted? I don't know.",
      "Ouch. I'm going to need some aloe.",
      "I wasn't listening to what you said, but I sure am outraged.",
      "Watch your tongue - and your back.",
      "Say that to my feathers.",
      "I think we're supposed to laugh, now?",
      "At what?",
      "Smile and nod, honey.",
      "Can we leave now?",
      "Damnit!",
      "I'm not laughing. I needed to say that just so you understand.",
      "Next time, try using more hard 'k' sounds.",
      "Ha ha ha.",
      "Hahaha... I don't know what that is.",
      "Behold. I am depleted of cares.",
      "Just... no.",
      "Get down with me!",
      "Aw, yeah, let's get down!",
      "Aw, yeah, come on!",
      "Alright, put your back in to it!",
      "Dust it off!",
      "Alright!",
      "Dance like your life depends on it.",
      "Dance.",
      "Move your feet, or lose some toes.",
      "Compromise. It's a pain.",
      "Call me cute again.",
      "This is how I deal with unwanted attention.",
      "This is a preemptive 'No'.",
      "Keep up.",
      "A dance with me ends in blood.",
      "Hear. My. Words!",
      "Hm, what shall I cut off?",
      "I don't speak compromise.",
      "I always find a weak spot.",
      "A thousand cuts is only the beginning.",
      "Cut by a feather? So delicate.",
      "Violence is my favorite form of negotiation.",
      "My feathers are priceless.",
      "They make chaos dance.",
      "All out of second chances. Sorry.",
      "Listening. Such a simple concept.",
      "Okay, so we're doing this.",
      "Threading the needle.",
      "Quit crying! It's just a feather.",
      "When I dance, I lead.",
      "My last nerve is long gone.",
      "A Vastayan feather is a kingly gift.",
      "This was our world first.",
      "Ever been stabbed by a feather?",
      "Yay, someone to throw knives at.",
      "I leave nasty scars.",
      "It's only a little prick.",
      "Are you having fun over there?\"",
      "I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!",
      "The fight's here!, by me!",
      "It's the same fight!",
      "You're doing this!",
      "Doing it!",
      "I hate everyone today!",
      "Even me?",
      "Not you, baby.",
      "Should we give them a fighting chance?",
      "Only if we want to have fun.",
      "Who do I hit?",
      "One of them!",
      "Ah.",
      "This reminds me of our first dates!",
      "Good times!",
      "Mind if I cut in, Rakan?",
      " Be my guest, miella!",
      "That was beautiful, baby!",
      "You see that?",
      "I couldn't miss it!",
      "Make them remember!",
      "They'll never forget.",
      "Let's show 'em what we got.",
      "Happily.",
      "You love it when I slap fools?",
      "You know I do!",
      "This is the plan, right?",
      "It is now!",
      "What do you want to do later?",
      "I can think of something.",
      "You hungry?",
      "Can we talk about this later?",
      "But... but... food!",
      "You're cute today!",
      "Eyes on the prize, baby.",
      "Let me at 'em!",
      "Rakan is very enthusiastic.",
      "I want to show 'em!",
      "I adore your energy.",
      "Do we need any of these fools?",
      "Not a single one.",
      "Use your words!",
      "Can't! Punching!",
      "I have your back!",
      "I have your back!",
      "How long since we last danced?",
      "Too long.",
      "These guys look silly!",
      "Bunch of weirdos.",
      "How many fights we gotta win?",
      "All of them!",
      "Nope!",
      "Nope!",
      "Nuh uh!",
      "Nope!",
      "Sit down!",
      "Eat it!",
      "Didn't see that coming?",
      "Gotcha!",
      "Gotcha!",
      "Gotcha.",
      "Pinned!",
      "Oops, your bad!",
      "Oops, your bad.",
      "Feathers fly!",
      "What? They were in my way.",
      "As far as obstacles go, that was about a... three out of ten?",
      "Anyone else want to try?",
      "Thanks for the dance.",
      "Few can keep up with me.",
      "Alright, who's next?",
      "And an F, for effort.",
      "Got what they deserved.",
      "I'm overcome with emotion.",
      "That was for the Vastaya.",
      "Well, they tried to stop me.",
      "Well, that's done.",
      "Hm, dodging seems to be a weak spot of yours.",
      "I warned you. Oh, wait, did I? Crap. My fault.",
      "Yep. Easy peasy.",
      "That's my baby.",
      "Ah, it was nothing.",
      "Did I do that?",
      "No. That was me.",
      "Who's counting?",
      "Me. I'm counting.",
      "Miella, I helped, right?",
      "Couldn't have done it without you, mieli.",
      "Every time you do that, it drives me crazy.",
      "Well. I'll have to do it more often, then.",
      "Were... they trying?",
      "Probably, but there are two of us.",
      "I love watching you kill.",
      "I love killing for you.",
      "Let's make out.",
      "Haha! Told you!",
      "Rakan, let's not gloat. Much.",
      "Did they deserve it?",
      "They deserved it.",
      "Why do they break so easily?",
      "They aren't made like us.",
      "Pity.",
      "That was a Vastayan farewell.",
      "Isn't a Vastayan farewell when you say, \"ouulavaash?",
      "I was trying to have a moment, Rakan.",
      "Did you see that? Haha! That was amazing!",
      "Nice job, babe.",
      "They couldn't keep up with you.",
      "Only you can, Rakan.",
      "Too bad those tails weren't lives.",
      "We asked you to join.",
      "This is by your design.",
      "The Vastaya will sing songs of you. I promise.",
      "Mu'takl.",
      "Shame. You could have been so useful alive.",
      "Every drop of Vastayan blood spilled is a waste.",
      "Taitah be tervaash.",
      "It needed to be done.",
      "Wasn't she just a ray of sunshine? I hate sunshine.",
      "And that's where plucky optimism gets you.",
      "Hurray, they all died.",
      "It's more of a slaughter than a massacre, really.",
      "I wish they could have seen the looks on their faces.",
      "Maybe I overdid it.",
      "I wasn't joking when I said nothing stands in my way.",
      "A victory for the Vastaya.",
      "Magic is again unfettered.",
      "Untied that mystical knot.",
      "Another minor annoyance reduced to rubble.",
      "Crumble! Yes!",
      "I could dance right now. Aw, but there's more work to be done.",
      "Can you feel the magic flowing? I can.",
      "Sabotage looks so good on me.",
      "I've been known to implode a sacred obelisk or two.",
      "I will unblock the rivers of Vastayan essence.",
      "Each totem that falls strengthens the Vastayan cause.",
      "We rise.",
      "Another Vastayan victory.",
      "They should really get a refund from those masons.",
      "Hm, poor construction. No standards.",
      "Shoddy construction, through and through.",
      "Good henchmen are hard to find.",
      "Next.",
      "Nothing is ever easy, but that was really easy.",
      "That was too easy - but so much fun.",
      "Don't feel bad, they're just magically animated sheets of cloth.",
      "They mindlessly marched right to their deaths - like everyone in Noxus.",
      "They dropped something. Their guard.",
      "This is overpriced - but I must have it.",
      "I want to buy all the things!",
      "I am totally pulling this off.",
      "What the heck? I deserve it.",
      "I know I'm being price gouged, but I'll splurge.",
      "Where did you get all these wonderful things?",
      "Is this ethically sourced?",
      "Hook me up with that magical creature discount?",
      "Do I really need this? Ah... yes.",
      "But how much does it cost for me?",
      "I must know their every move.",
      "Sometimes, I have to watch my own back.",
      "Eyeball in the grass.",
      "I need a strategic viewpoint.",
      "Let's have a look-see, shall we?",
      "This is ambush territory.",
      "I never walk into a trap unprepared.",
      "I hate surprises - unless I'm doing the surprising.",
      "See the enemy, know their mind.",
      "Rebellions thrive on intelligence.",
      "And they won't be needing that any more.",
      "Die, little inanimate spy.",
      "Found one! Killed it.",
      "Good thing I didn't do anything embarrassing.",
      "There's more than one way to blind an enemy.",
      "Well, that's just an invasion of privacy.",
      "You okay?",
      "Better now.",
      "I got you!",
      "Thanks, babe.",
      "You're welcome.",
      "Thank you.",
      "Thank you!",
      "Any time!",
      "Thank you, honey!",
      "That help?",
      "Appreciated!",
      "Aw, you're looking out for me!",
      "Always.",
      "I'm going now. Where? Anywhere not here. That's where.",
      "Well, I'm bored.",
      "Bored now.",
      "We gotta go.",
      "Wait for me!",
      "Xayah out.",
      "Don't leave without me!",
      "You going somewhere?",
      "Why not?",
      "Aw... crap... ",
      "Rakan... ",
      "Seriously... ?",
      "Uh, seriously... ?",
      "Ugh, lame... ",
      "Ugh, lame... ",
      "Death was a nice vacation from the tedium - but nothing good can last, I suppose.",
      "Death was nice and peaceful. Thanks for ruining it.",
      "I always wanted to be buried and resurrected in this outfit.",
      "Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet.",
      "Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet.",
      "Tell me where the First Light is and maybe I won't destroy Valoran City. Nah, I'll do it anyway.",
      "Nice world. It would be a shame if something bad happened to it.",
      "Hey, Saki, ready to rough someone up?",
      "Thatta girl.",
      "We're teaming up with the Star Guardians?!",
      "'Just like old times?' Don't tell me you're enjoying this.",
      "The Star Guardians. I was gonna deal with them later but… oh, well.",
      "Great, the Star Guardians.",
      "We are not friends.",
      "You sure this is a good idea?",
      "We have no choice.",
      "Don't get killed again.",
      "Like you can talk.",
      "Ready to take over the universe?",
      "Stick to the plan.",
      "I thought you said we didn't have one?",
      "We have a plan, and it's evil and awesome!",
      "Whatever you say, babe!",
      "Ugh, I hate the forces of good.",
      "I know what'll cheer you up.",
      "Murdering the Star Guardians!",
      "Hey! I have an evil plan!",
      "You're sure it's an evil plan?",
      "Yeah! Riku and I'll just make it up as we go along!",
      "That doesn't sound very evil.",
      "Zoe's plans never go wrong!",
      "They always go wrong",
      "It's the Star Guardians' fault! The plans… work.",
      "Really?",
      "We might have to improvise.",
      "Good thing you got me, babe!",
      "Star Guardians, what a scam.",
      "Space is cold and dead and awesome.",
      "Who needs love when you've got a cloak made from dark matter knives?",
      "I can still feel the First Star calling to me… psyche!",
      "Dreams are only real until you wake up.",
      "Good is subjective. Evil is cool, and has spikes and stuff.",
      "There's a dark side to every story.",
      "Anybody wanna join the dark side? No? Eh, I tried.",
      "Who's afraid of a little villainous insurrection?",
      "I'm only bad on the outside… and the inside.",
      "Every hero has a villain they created.",
      "With the First Star gone, chaos will reign.",
      "Look at all this happiness and joy. Gross.",
      "Trouble doesn't 'follow me'. I am trouble.",
      "Every light goes dark. It's just a matter of time.",
      "Love conquers nothing and everything ends.",
      "All this starlight is ruining my natural evil glow.",
      "Why are we even bothering with the First Star?",
      "Whatever.",
      "Saki, please. You know I don't leave survivors.",
      "Ever think about old times?",
      "Yeah, me neither.",
      "You know my love will save you.",
      "Cut it out. We're being evil.",
      "I need you to be more careful.",
      "If anybody is gonna die first, it's gonna be me. I can't see you die again.",
      "Hey, Xayah. Xayah.",
      "What? Did you… say something?",
      "Meh, nevermind.",
      "What are those things the Star Guardians wear?",
      "Shoes?",
      "No. Those cool swoopy flowy scarf things. I want a blue one.",
      "Remember that time on the lonely planet?",
      "Didn't we… die there?",
      "Being alone with you was very romantic. I wanna go back.",
      "But… we died.",
      "Why can't the Star Guardians just embrace destruction?",
      "They're too busy making stupid high school plans.",
      "Why?",
      "Because they're gross losers.",
      "If you don't wanna go with me-",
      "No, I'm ready.",
      "And you don't need to change outfits twenty times before we leave.",
      "Nah, being a handsome villain is a good look for me.",
      "I'll play the part of the 'evil Star Guardian returned from the grave'… but I don't have to be enthused about it.",
      "I loved being left to die on an abandoned monster planet. Real character building experience.",
      "The First Light failed us but I'm not bitter. I just wanna kill the Star Guardians and destroy everything.",
      "Enforcing order on a chaotic universe was never going to work. The First Star lied.",
      "Why is it so bright out here? Can't we kill the sun or something? It's literally a star.",
      "Why are all the Star Guardians going to high school together?",
      "That's not an answer and you know it.",
      "Where is Rakan, anyway?",
      "What do you mean 'trying to save me?'",
      "I'll always take chaos and darkness over those stupid little star animals.",
      "Not you, Saki.",
      "Too bad you couldn't save me, Ahri. Now, who's going to save you?",
      "A boy who won't stop talking. How cool and unique.",
      "Janna. Guess they'll give mysterious backstories to anyone these days.",
      "That attitude won't protect you, Jinx. Trust me. I know.",
      "You're young, Lulu, so let me give you some advice. Ditch those losers.",

      "So you're good and I'm evil? Great, Poppy. We understand each other.",
      "Rakan, get back over here and stop trying to heroically sacrifice yourself. You look ridiculous.",
      "Soraka. Are you really that dense or just afraid to tell them the truth?",
      "Heh. Syndra. I was wondering when you'd show up.",
      "I know you turned me against my friends, Zoe. Now, you'll pay for it.",
      "Stop trying to make Star Guardian happen. It's not gonna happen.",
      "Ugh, footie pajamas? You guys are the worst.",
      "You're really in for it now.",
      "Okay. Calm down, Saki.",

      "Your turn to die, Ahri.",
      "Quit biting my style, Jinx!",
      "You should have never taken the oath, Lux!",
      "Here's a toast to our reunion, Sarah.",
      "You'll pay for running, Neeko!",
      "Time for some couples counseling.",
      "Consider this my resignation, Zoe!",
      "You expected to win? That's bleak.",
      "Don't ruffle your feathers over it.",
      "In the real world, the bad guys always win.",
      "You call that a fight? Pfft, this planet doesn't stand a chance.",
      "Hands down, this is the best day I can ever remember.",
      "Wanna peck their eyes out?",
      "Lame.",
      "Well, you were certainly there.",
      "Time to say 'farewell' to those pitiful star losers.",

      "Sure, honey. Whatever you like.",
      "Sorry, what was that about destiny? Didn't quite catch it.",
      "Well, at least you stopped talking.",
      "So many secrets, Janna, and they all die with you.",
      "Sparkle party's over. Where's my gift bag?",
      "Heh. It's nothing personal, kid.",
      "Looks like this little star burned out.",
      "Here's something the First Star won't teach you. Revenge is an excellent motivator.",
      "You couldn't hide from me forever, Neeko.",
      "Guess evil wins, Poppy. I, for one, am shocked.",
      "Sorry, Love. You can't save me this time.",
      "That's the problem with playing dumb. Sooner or later, it'll get you killed.",
      "Zoe will reward me for this, Syndra. Apparently, you two have history.",

      "Damn it! Not again.",
      "Ugh, get me out of there. I hate being cooped up in the gem.",
      "Surprise, surprise. I didn't stay dead and now I'm angry.",

      "So... when exactly you planning on getting the hell outta' here?",
      "Woo, no sir, I ain't gonna' kill you and feed you to my lizard! Them's just... malicious rumours!",

      "You may be from Noxus, but you ain't Noxian.",
      "Don't mess with Noxus, brother.",
      "You know, I like you, brother. As much as I can like a lily-livered jungle-sniffer.",
      "You sure you're Noxian? You look a little Ionian to me.",
      "Watch your stepping! That's my land you're gallivanting on!",
      "Drinking from battle? What kind of dumb crap is that?",
      "Telling people you're a god? Hell, you're barely a paring knife.",
      "Something caught in your throat? 'cause you sound desperate!",
      "Say that again! I dare you.",
      "Thems fighting words! See, Skaarl? That's why I don't like people.",
      "Shut your mouth hole! Them badgers are listening.",
      "I'm just a Yordle standing in front of you, asking you to **shut the hell up!**",
      "Of course you realize, this means war.",
      "So, that's what considered funny in the city, huh?",
      "I got a joke too! It's called me kicking your teeth in!",
      "That it? That was your joke, huh?",
      "Was you making fun of my Skaarl?",
      "Real funny! Knew a funny guy in the Drekan Campaign - took a javelin in the spine, couldn't walk after that. Used him as a coat rack.",
      "Slow down so I can kill something!",
      "Get off my lawn!",
      "They's about to be dead!",
      "This land is my land!",
      "Damn trespassers!",
      "Step on my land again, you're done!",
      "How about a long axe in your guts?",
      "You are perturbing my tranquility!",
      "You should run! Skaarl likes his food lively!",
      "Don't interrupt me! I'm trying to start a fight!",
      "Damn city folk!",
      "I'm Kled, and this here's Skaarl. Prepare to die.",
      "This is how it's gonna work: I kill you, then I take your stuff.",
      "Look, Skaarl! It's dinner time!",
      "You see my welcome sign back there? No? It was your friend's skull!",
      "You will salute when you address me!",
      "Let's get them trespassers!",
      "Why ain't they saluting me? They should be saluting me! Salute me now!",
      "You get my invitation to visit? No? 'cause there ain't one!",
      "Let's do it!",
      "Oh, it's on!",
      "I got your welcoming present right here!",
      "The badgers command your death!",
      "Only coffin's gonna' be this lizard's belly!",
      "Let's get 'em, Skaarl!",
      "I might have to jump off this lizard and put my boot in your watoosie!",
      "Let's get 'em, 'fore they get us.",
      "I'm gonna murder you to death!",
      "I will murder your whole family!",
      "My brain is on fire, my soul is strong, and my lizard is hungry!",
      "You mocking me?",
      "He looked at me funny! Get him.",
      "You can't take what's mine!",
      "You looking at me? 'cause I'm gonna' kill you!",
      "You can't bushwhack a bushwhacker!",
      "You just justified a preemptive retaliatory strike!",
      "They came looking for a fight? Let's oblige 'em.",
      "I am justified, and I am armed!",
      "I'm through running!",
      "Die!",
      "I'll kill you!",
      "Now you done it!",
      "I'll gut you!",
      "I'll say something witty after I kill you!",
      "I'm gonna' cut you open and use your spine for a back scratcher, because it is itchy! Very itchy!",
      "I can only express myself through violence!",
      "Who sent you?",
      "Welcome to Noxus!",
      "This! Is! Noxus!",
      "I hate you!",
      "You's trying my patience!",
      "Come back here and fight!",
      "My axe talks for me!",
      "You thought I was done? Kled ain't never done!",
      "I can't be reasoned with!",
      "It's go time!",
      "I ain't stopping!",
      "You see, Skaarl? I'm doing it alone!",
      "I'll kill 'em all!",
      "See, Skaarl? I don't need help!",
      "Skaarl! You're missing the fun!",
      "I'm just beginning to fight!",
      "I'll kick the crap outta' you!",
      "No trespassing!",
      "Intruder!",
      "You're a cockroach, and it's half-past stomping time!",
      "My brain is full of weasels!",
      "Serenity now!",
      "I don't like sharing!",
      "Oh, you prancing bastard!",
      "My blood is piss and vinegar!",
      "I'm gonna reach down your throat, and turn your lungs into mittens!",
      "I'm gonna make you wish you were a hallucination!",

      "Woo, good timing!",
      "I knew you'd be back.",
      "Dang nabbit, I love this lizard!",
      "Boy am I glad to see you!",
      "The badgers command it!",
      "For the brain weasels!",
      "Yeehaw! I knew you couldn't quit me, Skaarl!",
      "Gotcha now!",
      "How you like that leash?",
      "Gotcha!",
      "Oh, you ain't getting away!",
      "You ain't running!",
      "Just try and run!",
      "You ain't going nowhere!",
      "Get back here!",
      "Thought you wanted to visit!",
      "You think you can run?",
      "I'm gonna learn you about pain!",
      "Come back, I gotta' put an axe in your brain!",
      "Aw, you ain't leaving, are you?",
      "Oops, bear trap in your neck!",
      "Get 'em!",
      "Hyaah!",
      "Woo!",
      "Get 'em, Skaarl!",

      "No prisoneeeers!",
      "This is Noxus, son! Winner takes all!",
      "That'll learn 'em!",
      "Thought you could take my land, huh? How'd that work out for you?",
      "How's that dirt taste?",
      "Don't worry, Skaarl! We'll come back so you can eat 'em later.",
      "Whoops! Looks like I accidentally stabbed you with my long axe - until you were dead!",
      "You were a visitor, now you're mulch!",
      "Skaarl, that was what we call a predictable scenario.",
      "I told 'em what was gonna' happen if they came onto my land!",
      "Next time you visit, bring more stuff I can take!",
      "I might be a deranged lizard-riding bandito, but I whooped you real good!",
      "Now, I might have overreacted to you unlawfully entering my property - but I don't think so!",
      "Ahahahaha! I warned him! I did warn him!",
      "It's funny, 'cause he died right on the border of my land, and more of my land!",
      "Glad you could visit!",
      "Don't let the door hit you on your way to hell!",
      "They never learn.",
      "Tried to bushwhack a bushwhacker!",
      "That learned 'em real good.",
      "We didn't come here to teach lessons in humanity!",
      "Y'all made a nice stabbing bag.",
      "Killing makes me thirsty.",
      "Nothing like a river of blood to send a message.",
      "Y'know, a long time ago, being crazy meant something.",
      "Just 'cause we was kin don't mean I ain't feeding you to Skaarl!",
      "Hey cous', glad you came to visit!",
      "A relative's just another unwanted guest.",
      "Afraid I had to cut your visit short.",
      "You ain't cute now!",
      "Aw, you are so cute... 'fore I ripped your fuzzy head off!",
      "I could feel bad about killing you, or we could stomp on your corpse!",
      "You was cute - lousy, but cute.",
      "He died as dumb as he sounded.",
      "And he ain't even had the indignity to call himself a demon.",
      "Never had much to say, but I'm sure glad we shut him up.",
      "Girl was all messed up.",
      "I mean, before we killed her. Snake for legs? Crazy!",
      "I guess it's snake dinner tonight!",
      "Was that lady half-snake, or that snake half-human? She is... confusing. Dead, but confusing.",
      "Hey, lizard food! What exactly was you general of?",
      "Nice axe! Learn to use it!",
      "Death by **my** hand!",
      "He wanted to unify Noxus. Guess that makes me a secessionist.",
      "**KLEEEEEED**... naw, it's just Kled.",
      "Who wants some Kled?",
      "This is where Kled shines!",
      "Skaarl? You eatin' good tonight! That girl's got some meat on her!",
      "And you thought I talked crazy!",
      "I gotta' stop the mushroom juice... I swear that girl had some tentacles or something!",
      "Bye bye, fancy pants!",
      "Hey, fancy pants! Got your cloak dirty!",
      "I don't know what he was. I just needed him to shut up.",
      "I can respect crazy, but what kind of fool reloads in the middle of a fight?",
      "A sinister blade? Heck, girl, Skaarl's got farts more sinister than you was.",
      "I like a girl with moxie.",
      "No, obviously she didn't have any! That's the darn point!",
      "Humans is such easy prey.",
      "She had one crazy getup! Them city-folk clothes is getting ridiculous.",
      "Yeah, I'll try it on later.",
      "Go back to Noxus Prime!",
      "All your little city-girl dreams just got stomped.",
      "We wrecked that thing!",
      "Damn varmint left holes all over the yard.",
      "Queen of what? Darn thing made Skaarl look smart!",
      "Pure Noxian girl. Almost liked her. Almost.",
      "Seems to have lost your bounce, girl.",
      "All that hippy hop! Getting on my nerves!",
      "How many times do I gotta' kill him?",
      "I know!",
      "Too stupid to live, too dumb to die.",
      "I don't think you can eat that one.",
      "He looks a little overripe.",
      "Huh. I liked him better when he was alive.",
      "Tactician? More like bird brain.",
      "Master Tactician? He can keep that title.",
      "He gonna' taste good deep-fried.",
      "I figure he gonna' taste like chicken.",
      "Sure!",
      "Well, that shut him up!",
      "Finally, some silence.",
      "I knew he was a liar, 'cause he used them big words.",
      "I've seem some dumb outfits, Skaarl, but a cape made out of knives? Woo, ha! That took the cake!",
      "Another dead city boy, thinking he could sneaky-sneak on my land.",
      "Let that be a lesson for all them sneaky-sneaks!",
      "I keep my eyes open - all the time.",
      "I ain't paranoid - I'm ready. Real ready.",
      "They's always trying to sneak up on us. Trying, that is.",
      "I know them trespassers is somewhere...",
      "Them sneaky-sneaks ain't gonna' sneak on us, no sir!",
      "It's mine, and I got my eye on it!",
      "Yeah, any of them varmints sneak up on us, we'll know.",
      "It ain't paranoia if everyone **is** out to get you.",
      "Paranoia... means having all the facts.",
      "There's no such thing as paranoia; your worst fears can come true at any moment.",

      "Combo platter!",
      "That was **stellar!** Get it? Star Guardian? Stellar?",
      "Bam! It's lights out for you!",
      "It wasn't me! My guns have minds of their own.",
      "You'll be missed, Janna!\" Jinx laughs. \"Not by me.",
      "Make room for the new kid on the block!",
      "So, how did that taste, Lulu?",
      "This almost breaks my heart, Lux.",
      "I killed Poppy!\" Jinx laughs. \"Who's next?",

      "Look, Kuro! Life insurance!",
      "Now we're talking, Shiro!",

      "Yeeeeesss...",
      "Yeeesss...",

      "I am unstoppable!",
      "Try and stop me!",
      "So close to perfection! Who's next?",
      "Stand back! It's only going to get messier...",
      "Don't stop now! I'm so close!",
      "Yes! Bow before greatness!",
      "Bringer of death! Taker of lives! Rhaast, if you're in a hurry.",
      "All have fallen before me! I am the undoing!",
      "That was all me!",
      "Kneel before Rhaast!",
      "Is there no one left to kill? You're welcome...",
      "You hear that? Neither do I—because everyone is dead!",
      "Perfect; one size kills all.",
      "Seems redundant.",
      "Helpful to know who I'm murdering.",
      "Okay... These can be useful.",
      "Done. Resume slaughter!",
      "What can I say? I like destroying things!",
      "I prefer the sound of flesh being torn, but oh well...",
      "I'd prefer to gouge out all their eyes, but this will have to do.",
      "I guess that is better than walking.",
      "I'd rather be unleashing wrath.",
      "I already miss killing!",
      "Again! This time, they die!",
      "Hm. So that's what dying feels like. Good thing I'm immortal!",
      "Okay! That did not work.",
      "The fullness of my truth stands revealed!",
      "I have snuffed out the darkin, who dares stand against me?",
      "The child is gone. The killer remains.",
      "The blade of millenia exercises my will.",
      "I wield the whisper of darkness.",
      "I bested the darkin, now the plan continues.",
      "Zed now walks in my shadow.",

      "Kill the mind. Build the mind. Free the mind.",
      "My path cuts through the bodies of the unwilling.",
      "This is as it was meant to be.",
      "My greatness has been realized.",
      "With this blade, I am invincible!",
      "Light offers no sanctuary.",
      "True believers live forever, they will die forgotten.",
      "Bathing my enemies in shadow, I leave the light to the opressed.",
      "I was forged by the uncaring providence of war.",
      "Every corpse a lesson, every threat a target.",
      "The darkin is gone, our enemies are next.",
      "Your stance is that of a two-legged goat.",
      "This is the part where you run.",
      "Together Zed, we are unstoppable!",
      "They will never see us coming.",
      "I'll let you in on a secret, you will not live much longer.",
      "The light's your best chance, but you're still going to die.",
      "There are twelve ways to kill you. Sorry, thirteen. It's still thirteen.",
      "Hah ha ha ha...",
      "Shadows touch all!",
      "Your mistake!",
      "No way out.",
      "I'm here!",
      "I am everywhere.",
      "This will be quick!",
      "Silence, then pain.",
      "Run, from the shadows.",
      "You dance on the shadows edge.",
      "Shadow is not your friend.",
      "The light will not save you.",
      "Fleeing won't save you!",
      "Feel this!",
      "I'm coming for you!",
      "Pain fades...",
      "Death is inevitable.",
      "Die, Noxian!",
      "I will enjoy this, Darius.",
      "Revenge...",
      "How tedious.",
      "These things always prove to be a challenge.",
      "Ughh... This may take a while.",
      "I am the shadow of death.",
      "I am chosen! The darkin stain lives no more.",
      "In death, Rhaast now serves me.",
      "I am now one! I am the one!",
      "No escape...",
      "I am everywhere!",
      "Hush...",
      "Hah ha ha ha...",
      "Fools die and are forgotten.",
      "Retreat was a better option.",
      "So brave, so foolish, so dead.",
      "You will not be remembered.",
      "You were not chosen—to live...",
      "There was a time to run, but you missed it.",
      "Wrong place, wrong time.",
      "Be thankful it's over.",
      "Surprise!",
      "Goodbye!",
      "So easy.",
      "That never gets old.",
      "Strength alone is not enough.",
      "You and Rhaast, the failed blades.",
      "Zed says hello, and goodbye.",
      "It did not have to end this way, Zed.",
      "Your stance was weak, your tactics elementary and your execution sluggish.",
      "The more they send, the more they will bury.",
      "The fallen only make me stronger.",
      "Shadows and the blade proved too much.",
      "Perfection is near...",
      "That may do, for some.",
      "Four. Who's next?",
      "And that is why I am the one.",
      "They too will call me master.",
      "They should stay down.",
      "Death finds all, and so quickly.",
      "Balance? Balance favors the victorious.",
      "I buy, they die. Simple.",
      "Oh yes, this is the right choice.",
      "I live in shadow, others need light.",
      "My enemies will have no place to hide.",
      "This trinket may prove useful here.",
      "Oh, please.",
      "Sight, a pitiful crutch for the weak.",
      "Are you afraid now? You should be.",
      "That was not the plan.",
      "A lucky stab in the dark.",
      "That only served to sharpen my focus, and my blade.",
      "Can the others hear me?",
      "I don't think so.",
      "So you sound like a lunatic, excellent.",
      "So we're allies, are we? Fine.",
      "Stop talking to them, idiot!",
      "Oh good, insults. That's the way to make friends!",
      "Rhaast..? Why are you trembling?",
      "It's nothing Kayn. Nothing at all.",
      "The crew of the Morningstar! Here and ready to die!",
      "Remember, leave the templar alive.",
      "Yes, yes, whatever.",
      "I can feel them Kayn. Those troublesome little rats.",
      "So we kill them all?",
      "Eventually... yes.",
      "There is power locked inside you Rhaast, and I will have it.",
      "Oh good, more empty threats. You know how much I love them.",
      "With the Ora you wield, we could destroy everything!",
      "With all the stupid things you say, we could fill a library.",
      "Kill them Kayn. Show me the power of our future emperor.",
      "You didn't say the magic word.",
      "This world will be the first step on my road to conquest.",
      "Talk, talk, talk. All you ever do is talk, Rhaast! Learn to read a room.",
      "It doesn't matter what you are Rhaast. I'm going to win, and you're going to die. ",
      "My Ora is none of your concern, Rhaast.",
      "I should've bombed this toilet world from orbit.",
      "Deep down Rhaast, I know you're scared I'll win.",
      "While our useless emperor sat on his throne, I ensured the survival of our dominion.",
      "Identify the weak link, and break it!",
      "You're pretty confident for an antiquated lawn mower Rhaast.",
      "I've trained all my life to serve the empire. Now it will serve me!",
      "I will be emperor. I just need time and Ora.",
      "This is all this galaxy has to offer?",
      "Slaughter them all. And drink deeply.",
      "Stride forth, Kayn. Burn the galaxy behind you.",
      "I am asleep and awake. The voice of Ora! Locked behind a cumbling wall.",
      "An empire that spans galaxies. And you still can't afford a decent haircut.",
      "They use our blood for fuel Kayn! Our Ora, and they will pay so dearly.",
      "Newly minds cannot comprehend... uhh, how deserving you truly are.",
      "Ora is ambrosia. So sweet, so pure.",
      "Gourge yourself on Ora Kayn. Only you are worthy.",
      "The best thing about Ora, is how it tastes.",
      "Build your empire, over their graves.",
      "Give in to the carnage. Lose yourself in me.",
      "So you're the voice of Ora.",
      "Yes, and your guiding star.",
      "The universe will be mine!",
      "We'll see.",
      "Unlock my power, I command it!",
      "Settle down. You're embarrassing yourself.",
      "You're just a tool to me, Rhaast.",
      "How ironic.",
      "I don't need you to rule the universe.",
      "Then why can't you put me down?",
      "Don't you have any flair for the dramatic!?",
      "What are you? Really?",
      "All the Ora within you.",
      "They will learn to fear the name of Kayn!",
      "Just kill everyone! It's much more efficient.",
      "I'm not sure I believe Ora is sentient.",
      "I don't care what you believe.",
      "Do you know the difference between a villain and a monster?",
      "The will to do what's necessary.",
      "For an ancient mysterious artifact, you sure love to hear yourself talk.",
      "I've been trapped on a backwater planet for untold millenia. Indulge me.",
      "Where did you come from? What do you want?",
      "Your feeble mind couldn't comprehend it if you tried.",
      "Why do they run from the inevitable?",
      "It makes for a better story.",
      "Null this insufferable life!",
      "Yes you're a monster, very scary.",
      "Don't you feel it Kayn? The desire to rule! The desire for carnage!",
      "Every waking moment.",
      "In the future I see a great empire!",
      "**My** future! **My** empire!",
      "I am no mere plaything.",
      "You said it, not me.",
      "So. Much. Ora within you!",
      "Quit looking at my Ora.",
      "Kill them all! It would be so easy.",
      "And so uninspired.",
      "Burn! Slaughter! Destroy!",
      "Ever the cliché.",
      "Your thirst for violence demands satisfaction.",
      "Satisfy yourself. I have bigger plans.",
      "Sometimes I question your resolve.",
      "Rhaast, I'm hurt.",
      "One day I will rule the universe.",
      "Maybe, if you focus for once.",
      "Wow Rhaast, I thought we were friends.",
      "Soon they'll all worship at my feet.",
      "Is that truly all you desire?",
      "Oh Rhaast, of course it is.",
      "What does the voice of Ora say today?",
      "Go to hell Kayn.",
      "Already there Rhaast, already there.",
      "Why is that girl staring at me?",
      "She is attracted to our violence.",
      "Oh...",
      "Malphite! What a loyal dog you are.",
      "Dogs die everyday.",
      "At last, Sona. The secrets of the Ora Gate will be mine!",
      "Yes... yours...",
      "Captain Yasuo! Why don't you tell me where you're hiding the templar?",
      "And then die!",
      "So you're that disgraced miner Ziggs.",
      "Not even good enough for the B Team!",
      "Do you know who I am?",
      "They require a demonstration!",
      "We'll make a game of it. You try to survive-",
      "And we slice you in half.",
      "What is this... thing before me?",
      "Just another worm.",
      "Are they taunting us!?",
      "And I thought you were a drama queen.",
      "Does that gaudy crest serve as a shield?",
      "No.",
      "Interesting...",
      "What exactly are they the master of?",
      "Dying, being dead. Both.",
      "Hey Rhaaast.",
      "What?",
      "Rhaast.",
      "What!?",
      "**Rhaast.**",
      "**What do you want Kayn!?**",
      "...Hi.",
      "Should we do Karaoke night again?",
      "No one can know about that.",
      "So... next weekend, then?",
      "An imperial soldier and a monster from an alternate reality walk into a bar-",
      "Waait! What was that last part?",
      "They're in a bar, Kayn! Pay attention.",
      "Do your people consider that funny?",
      "We do not.",
      "You look strong.",
      "Misguided fool.",
      "This will be riveting.",
      "Let's swat this insect!",
      "Surgical precision.",
      "You are annoying.",
      "Mind if I cut in?",
      "This one's mine.",
      "Let's make this quick.",
      "A welcome change of pace.",
      "Let's get you some new scars.",
      "Ahh. A volunteer.",
      "Don't cry when you lose.",
      "Don't run. I hate that!",
      "Drown them in me!",
      "Haha! Marvelous!",
      "Shatter their bones!",
      "Drag me across their throats!",
      "Drive me into their heart.",
      "What boundless violence!",
      "Pain. Bring them pain!",
      "Cut off their face.",
      "Let the darkness in.",
      "Rip out their organs.",
      "I want to hear them scream!",
      "Keep cutting.",
      "Spread my silence.",
      "Radiant flesh!",
      "Cull their numbers!",
      "Come and play, Jinx!",
      "Haha, so much flesh to rend, Malphite!",
      "Sona! You will open the gate!",
      "Face me Captain! Face me and die!",
      "You should never have come here, Ziggs.",
      "Nowhere to run.",
      "Hush...",
      "Why keep them waiting?",
      "I'm always close.",
      "How interesting.",
      "Such a useful talent.",
      "Your Ora is mine.",
      "Peekaboo.",
      "What inviting insides!",
      "How wonderful!",
      "Is there anyone left who can keep up with me?",
      "Right down the middle!",
      "Bah, I win.",
      "That sounded wet! Was it organs? Was it blood?",
      "One less subject to rule. Right, Kayn?",
      "The empire thanks you.",
      "As do I.",
      "Hmm, that murder reminded me of home.",
      "How sweet.",
      "Did those two... seem familiar?",
      "I think I'm having an existential crisis.",
      "I admit, she was cute.",
      "Oh are you kidding me?",
      "If only they all had that much flesh!",
      "Eugh, Rhaast. Nooo.",
      "I told you to leave her alive!",
      "Change of plans.",
      "First your brother, then you. It's poetic, really.",
      "He popped! How splendid!",
      "I think some got on me.",
      "Get off my planet! Get out of my galaxy, and stay... **dead**.",
      "It's like they were never there!",
      "High five Rhaast!",
      "Down low - oh, I don't have hands. How mature.",
      "We need to regroup.",
      "Regroup, or retreat?",
      "T-they're the same thing!",
      "Really?",
      "What happened to us Kayn? We used to be so good together.",
      "I hate the way you say that.",
      "What, getting tired already?",
      "I don't see you helping out.",
      "I'm the scythe, idiot! I only help out!",
      "Please, don't drop me on the ground.",
      "A little help... Anyone?",
      "Wait, how are we still alive?",
      "That, would ruin the surprise.",
      "I don't trust how easily you brought me back to life.",
      "Would you rather stay dead?",
      "...No.",
      "I won't let you die that easily.",
      "I appreciate the thought.",
      "I'm sure you do.",
      "It turns out the scythe was evil and wants to annihilate all reality. Who could've guessed?",
      "What an honour, Kayn. To watch me slaughter everything you wished to rule.",
      "The test has ended. I am victorious! I am the herald of oblivion! I! Am! Rhaast!",
      "Bare witness to the Dark Star! Bare witness to Rhaast!",
      "Kayn is gone. What is left is ruination!",
      "Scream for your lives, your world! Scream my name as I rip it all to pieces!",
      "It draws close. A vast and broken god.",
      "Witness the turning of the wheel. The culmination of this foul existence.",
      "We're all hurtling towards annihilation. I love it!",
      "Oh, the symphony of violence I will conduct.",
      "The entrails of countless realities are shattering in my wake!",
      "The voice of Ora? Heheha, what a joke.",
      "I herald an endless ocean of silence. It will be... transcendent.",
      "Love! Hope! Fear! I will feast it upon them all!",
      "Is it too late to mention I'm a corruptant, forged by the Dark Star? Sorry Kayn.",
      "Every luminous star laid bear. Torn open, devoured.",
      "Decay! An ecstasy I will carve into creation.",
      "Desolation lays before me, spanning endless eons until even time... dies!",
      "This reality has such... delicious entropy. ",
      "They should never have opened that gate! Hahaha!",
      "Look Kayn! Gaze upon my works, and despair.",
      "So much exquisite pain to deliver. Oh, I shudder at the thought.",
      "Pray for salvation that never comes!",
      "You've taken such good care of this body Kayn. Such exacting care.",
      "I feast upon the bones of unhallowed centuries. Nothing will escape me.",
      "I am the beautiful end, that awaits us all.",
      "Hear the sweet whispers of oblivion.",
      "I do look better in gold! Hehaha!",
      "Yes! The convulsing of the stars! I can taste their delectable screams.",
      "Know true fear, for I am the star where nightmares breed!",
      "Poor Kayn! Our would-be emperor tumbling endlessly into darkness!",
      "The succor of an endless void. Do you feel it Kayn?",
      "The geometry of space bends, and breaks, and bleeds!",
      "Kayn's Ora will fuel my slaughter! Ahahaha, oh yes.",
      "Well now, I'm not familiar with your universe. But oh, how I could be.",
      "I'll paint the dying stars with your entrails, and love every second of it.",
      "There will come soft rains of liquid night, when our empty god descends from its heaven.",
      "Remember to scream my name when I tear out your organs. That really does it for me.",
      "Are you watching my sovereign? We are but humble servants.",
      "Such bravado! I must free it from your prison of flesh.",
      "Mastery! The last twitch of a dying insect.",
      "I'm gonna use that mastery to saw off your head.",
      "Who wants to party before the world ends? Anyone? Just me? Fiine.",
      "I'm not acting creepy. I'm just really excited to be here!",
      "Here's a funny one. I'm going to kill you. Hmhe, end of joke! End of existence! End of everything! Hahahaha!",
      "Heyahaha! I love peeling open the funny ones.",
      "Oblivion awaits!",
      "Nothing will survive.",
      "The nightmare begins!",
      "Oh, how I've waited for this.",
      "May the violence never end!",
      "I will rip you apart.",
      "More. Mooore!",
      "Now's the feast!",
      "Let's open you up.",
      "What joyous carnage!",
      "Die! Die!",
      "Annihilation!",
      "I'm gonna get so much you on me.",
      "Entropy awaits!",
      "I will devour the stars!",
      "Yes, more violence!",
      "Every dying scream; they're all mine!",
      "I will paint the walls with your entrails!",
      "Scream before the end!",
      "Sweet desolation!",
      "I want it. Every cry of agony!",
      "I never want this to stop.",
      "I will carve myself upon you.",
      "I herald oblivion!",
      "I am the deliverance you crave.",
      "Even death will die!",
      "Let's see that meat on the outside!",

      "Jinx! Let's see who can do the most damage.",
      "Malphite! So much flesh to carve!",
      "Face the monster you've unleashed, Sona!",
      "You will greet oblivion with joy, Yasuo!",
      "Ziggs! Let's end this with a bang.",
      "Give your flesh to me!",
      "What a beautiful body!",
      "What's happening?",

      "Sad little girl. You have no idea what violence truly means.",
      "The bigger they are, the louder they scream.",
      "I thank you templar. For dooming all of creation.",
      "The only odyssey awaiting you, captain, is your own extinction.",
      "Hmm. Your exploding body, reminds me... of other, exploding bodies.",
      "Fear the coming of the dark!",
      "I will wash this universe clean!",
      "Such ecstasy! Such resplendent horror!",
      "Don't worry, I won't be gone long. If you do need me, just whisper my name.",
      "Wait here for me. If I come back to any new dead bodies, I'm gonna be so angry.",

      "My throne awaits! I can see it. I can see everything!",
      "Oh Rhaast. You were holding out on me. This power feels so, good!",
      "Universe! Greet your emperor, and know despair!",
      "Rhaasty boy! What is this energy? I could rule over everything!",
      "I can feel Ora coursing through my veins! This. Is. Sublime!",
      "Divine providence. Unlimited power! Kayn.",
      "So much left to conquer. So much left to accomplish.",
      "Rhaast dared to test me, and was the first to learn his place.",
      "I passed the monster's test! I alone am fit to rule.",
      "Pray for any world that draws my attention.",

      "They will sing my name for a thousand years!",
      "My grandure will not be sullied.",
      "Subjugate all worlds! Every last one of them.",
      "All will kneel. Or burn with their worlds.",
      "Emperor Kayn. Such a magnificent title! I love it.",
      "Look upon me, world! Look upon your saviour!",
      "Now to bring the galaxy to its knees.",
      "They will love me. They will loove me!",
      "It's not the grandest stage for my empire. But it will be.",
      "An endless sea of stars, each one ripe for conquest.",
      "Every star in the sky belongs to me!",
      "I know you're watching Rhaast. And I love how much you hate this.",
      "Was there ever a greater emperor than Kayn? Nooo.",
      "All great armies are mine to command.",
      "I will rule as a tyrant, and they will love me for it.",
      "Worship my limitless splender! Worship it.",
      "Emperor Kayn! King of kings, our great will! Our guiding star.",
      "This universe, and everything in it, is mine.",
      "First I conquered the weapon, and next? Everything else.",
      "The timeless gulf of infinity. Completely at my mercy!",
      "I'm the one with power now Rhaast! You hear me!?",
      "With this much Ora at my command, my empire is invincible!",
      "Praise my name! Praise Emperor Kayn!",
      "You stand on the precipice of a deadly fate. Take a step. Face your emperor.",
      "I suppose I could honour you with death. All part of my duties, after all.",
      "What can I say? You're either the emperor of the universe or you're not me.",
      "You poor fool. You've just made a grave mistake.",
      "Everything belongs to me, worm. Even that mastery.",
      "Look at you. Flashing that utterly average mastery for everyone to see.",
      "I'm perfectly sane. Rhaast hasn't had any undue effect on... do you hear singing?",
      "Hey Rhaast, remember the time... right, right you're dead! I killed you!",
      "The emperor is wearing clothes! Who said he wasn't? Was it you!?",
      "You find that funny? What a small, insignificant speck you are.",
      "Sing my name!",
      "You dare.",
      "Entertain me!",
      "Die where you stand!",
      "You're a mere peasant.",

      "Submit to me!",
      "It's my throne. Mine!",
      "Ora, Ora, Ora!",
      "I said bow!",
      "You will fall in line.",

      "No escape!",
      "How dare you look upon me?",
      "It's all mine.",
      "No one is worthy.",

      "For my empire!",

      "All hail Kayn!",
      "Give me your Ora!",
      "For the empire.",
      "So easy. It's all so easy.",
      "I will take on all challengers to my throne.",
      "You could never hope to stop me, but I love that you tried.",
      "But I digress, who are you again?",
      "Did you see that Rhaast?\" *Nervous Laugh* \"...Rhaast?",
      "Didn't you know? I'm the emperor, so I win.",
      "No one will take my throne from me! Not even me.",
      "How sad. You would have made an excellent concubine.",
      "Now play dead. Who's a good boy?",
      "Goodbye, templar. And thank you for control of the universe.",
      "If you want my personal opinion, \"Hasaki\" is a really sad choice of last words.",
      "Isn't this better than dying alone on some backwater? You can answer later.",
      "Hail Kayn! The all-conquering!",
      "All will bow to my greatness!",
      "Rejoice! Your emperor is here!",
      "Can't trust the councilors. They're too tainted. Rhaast would've said... Hmhmhmhm Rhaast... ",
      "No line of secession. Hunt down everyone, all of their offspring, until there is only Kayn.",
      "The ruling bodies will have to be disassembled by force. Yes, cut them apart.",
      "But I was... invincible...",
      "My... empire..",
      "I will live forever!",
      "My legacy doesn't die here.",
      "Did you miss me? I know I did."

      "Before we can save the world, first we gotta see it!",
      "Mess with the yeti and you get the boy!",
      "I don't know what 'dastardly' means, but I'm gonna punch it!",
      "Lord Grompulus, Kevin Ribbiton of Croaksworth, your unjust reign ends here!",
      "Think Gromp's actually a princess? (Willump noises) I'm not kissing her!",
      "The fairy's voice was coming from over here! I bet that Gromp swallowed her!",
      "Gah! We've been poisoned, Willump! The only cure is to kick Gromp's butt!",
      "Let's Gromp it up!",
      "These krugs don't look happy to see us... They must be up to something, Willump!",

      "Are you sure they're really raptors? Or are they void monsters in disguise? (Willump noises) Pluck their feathers, Willump!",
      "We gotta stop the raptors before they become evil raptosaurs and try to eat the sun! (Willump noises) What? It could happen. (Willump noises)",

      "Murk Wolves, I come to fight you in the name of your archenemies! Murk Cats!",
      "Don't let them bite you, Willump, then you'll turn into a were-yeti! Wait, that would be awesome!",
      "The boy who cried wolf? That's not me. I never cry!",
      "He's sucking up all the blue in the world! We gotta stop him, Willump!",
      "Tell us what happened to the sentries, blue guy! Or someone's gonna get hurt!",
      "Beat up a bunch of tiny goobers, then you can fight the boss!",
      "We will banish you from this valley, rock-skin boulder-man!",
      "A stone sentinel! He must be guarding something, like a secret!",

      "Apologies, m'lady. We'll find a way to un-toadify you.",
      "May the crown pass to a more worthy Croaksworth. Like Tim! Or Jerry. Or Jeff. Or um... Hm.",

      "That was a weird cure. I hope I read the scroll right.",

      "Cruel hearted midnight!",
      "A loathsome foe unfit even for the pyre.",
      "The Old Gods have left this place.",
      "Cease thy struggles. Darkness will sing thee to thy rest.",
      "Go to thy degenerate gods. I cast thee from these shores.",
      "Our lands are safe from your eldritch rites... for now.",
      "The light within thee is gone.",
      "Rest now, in the cold of the dark light.",
      "Begone, Bard, and find someone else to amuse thee.",
      "I doubt the Old Gods look kindly on failure, Camille.",
      "In another life, I... I'm so sorry, Diana.",
      "Farewell, Elise. Such beauty is wasted on a monster.",
      "With thy death, Hecarim, who will tend to the Elderwood?",
      "Death Blossoms wilt in the darklight.",
      "Return to earth, conjurer. Slumber, and be born anew.",
      "How grossly incandescent.",
      "Farewell, Lissandra. May your dark prophecies trouble us no more.",
      "Thy test has ended, Taric. I have emerged victorious.",
      "This dark sun will eclipse all evil!",
      "Oh patron of light. Oh impassive eye. Wouldst thou aid thy chosen vessel?",
      "Oh, silver flame. Oh, empty starlight. I beseech thee.",
      "Oh baleful heavens. Oh vermilion darkness. Spirit me to thy embrace.",
      "How cruel.",
      "Cant'st thou not see?",
      "The ever darkness will not claim me yet.",
      "I will not end. This cleansing must be completed.",
      "I have sworn an oath, and intend not to break it.",
      "Day breaks upon the battlefield!",
      "You'll pay for your heresy, Diana!",
      "Alas, the sun sets once again.",
      "If only I could be so grossly incandescent!"
